## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore movie data and generate insights to assist Microsoft's new movie studio in making informed decisions about the types of films to create. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various movie datasets, we aim to identify key trends, successful genres, and potential profit opportunities in the movie industry.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

The datasets contain essential movie information, such as movie titles, ratings, budgets, domestic and foreign gross revenue, and much more.
### Project Questions
Through exploratory data analysis, we aim to answer the following key questions:

1. Genre Performance: Which genres of movies have demonstrated the highest performance in terms of ratings and audience votes? Based on this performance, which specific genre should Microsoft prioritize for production?

2. Domestic vs. Foreign Market: How does the performance of different movie genres compare between the domestic and foreign markets based on ratings and votes? This analysis will help Microsoft tailor their movie offerings for different regions.

3. Total Gross Revenue by Studio: What is the total gross revenue for each movie studio? Understanding the revenue generated by different studios can help Microsoft identify potential partners for collaborations.

4. Optimal Budget Allocation: To achieve the highest profit in movie production, what is the optimal budget amount that should be allocated? This analysis will assist Microsoft in efficiently utilizing its resources for maximum returns.

### Methodology
1. Selecting and Analyzing Datasets: Gather movie datasets from various sources, including Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. Explore the datasets to understand their contents and structure.

2. Cleaning the Datasets: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data to ensure consistency.

3. Generating Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to gain insights into the distribution of key variables, such as ratings, votes, budgets, and gross revenue.

4. Merging DataFrames to Work With Combine relevant datasets to create a comprehensive dataset that contains all the necessary information for analysis.

5. Visualization: Create visual representations to effectively communicate the findings by doing so we are able to highlight key trends and patterns in the data.

6. Recommendation: Based on the analysis, make concrete recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio. Recommend specific genres to prioritize for production, strategies to target domestic and foreign markets, potential studio partnerships, and an optimal budget allocation for movie production.

7. Conclusion: Summary of the key insights and observations obtained from the data analysis. Provide a comprehensive overview of the movie industry's current trends, successful genres, and revenue patterns.

### Recommendations
1. Genre Selection: Drama, Comedy, Action, Thriller, Adventure, Horror, and other genres have demonstrated high performance based on the number of movies produced and their ratings and votes. Microsoft should prioritize producing movies in these genres as they have proven to be popular among audiences.

2. Market Focus: The top four genres in both the domestic and foreign markets include Drama, Comedy, Action, and Adventure. These genres have a wide appeal in both markets, and Microsoft should focus on producing movies in these genres to target a global audience.

3. Studio Partnerships: Microsoft should consider forming partnerships with successful movie studios like BV, Fox, WB, Uni., and Sony, as they have recorded the highest total gross revenues. Collaborating with established studios can help Microsoft leverage its expertise and resources to ensure successful movie productions.

4. Budget Allocation: While there are movies with low production budgets and low profits, there is a positive relationship between the production budget and profit. Microsoft should aim to allocate a reasonable budget, around the median of $200 million, for its movie productions. This will increase the chances of achieving profitable outcomes while minimizing the risk of producing low-budget movies with limited potential for profit.

### Conclusion
Through extensive exploratory data analysis, we have identified key trends and insights in the movie industry. The recommended genres for Microsoft's new movie studio are Drama, Comedy, Action, Thriller, Adventure, Horror, and other genres which have demonstrated high performance in terms of ratings and votes. To target a global audience, Microsoft should focus on producing movies in these genres.

Furthermore, Microsoft should consider forming partnerships with successful studios like BV, Fox, WB, Uni., and Sony to leverage their expertise and resources for successful movie productions. Allocating a reasonable budget, around the median of $200 million, can lead to profitable outcomes while minimizing risks.

By following these recommendations and utilizing the insights from our data analysis, Microsoft's new movie studio can position itself for success in the competitive movie industry and create a diverse and captivating portfolio of films that resonate with audiences worldwide.
